# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
We Are Going to Create a simple Rock Paper Scissor Game Using Python.

# Explanation
First of all, Our program should ask the player whether it is a player vs player or player vs computer. Based upon the user decision the code will move on further. There will be 3 Turns based upon the user input it will decide which player should win. For every single try 1 point will be added based on winnings and if both player input is same then match will draw and no points will be rewarded. on some special cases like if player1 got 1 point in 1st try and player2 got 1 points in 2nd try and in 3rd try if match ties then both player1 and player2 will have 1 points in such cases another try will be rewarded. If nobody wins our program will run forever until anyone wins first
